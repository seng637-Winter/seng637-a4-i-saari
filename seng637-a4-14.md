# Introduction

This lab examined the use of mutation and GUI testing. Mutation testing was applied to the JFreeChart library, with testing from Lab 3 and outside. GUI testing was applied to the Home Depot website.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 

The following cases analyze the effects of mutation testing with this group's lab 3 test suite.

## getLength()
```
public double getLength() {
    return this.upper - this.lower;
}
```

Test cases used Range(-10, -5), Range(-5, 5), Range(5, 7) and Range(0, 4)

Mutants:

1. Replaced double subtraction with addition → KILLED Range(0,4) would not catch this mutant, but the other test ranges would.
2. Negated double field upper → KILLED Flipping sign of upper would result in a different number for length for any non-zero upper value.
3. Incremented (a++) double field upper → KILLED Mutant would result in length+1 which would be caught by every test case.


## getCentralValue
```
public double getCentralValue() {
    return this.lower / 2.0 + this.upper / 2.0;
}
```

The only test case used a Range(0, 4) object.

Mutants:

4. Substituted 2.0 with 1.0 → SURVIVED
If this.lower / 2.0 was replaced by this.lower / 1.0, the test result would not change and the mutant would survive.
5. Substituted 2.0 with 1.0 → KILLED
If this.upper / 2.0 was changed to 1.0, the result would change and the mutant would be killed.
6. Replaced double division with multiplication → SURVIVED
this.lower / 2.0 and this.lower * 2.0 would both result in 0 if this.lower was zero, so the mutant survives.

Mutant coverage would improve if another test case using non-zero bounds was added.


## contains
```
public boolean contains(double value) {
    return (value >= this.lower && value <= this.upper);
}
```

Tested using boundary value analysis with a Range(-10, -5).

Mutants:

7. removed conditional - replaced comparison check with false → KILLED
Boundary testing would cover cases that expect both false and true, so this mutant would be caught.
8. Less than to less or equal → KILLED
Switching between < and <= would be caught by test cases using the exact boundary value.


## intersects
```
public boolean intersects(double b0, double b1) {
    if (b0 <= this.lower) {
        return (b1 > this.lower);
    }
    else {
        return (b0 < this.upper && b1 >= b0);
    }
}
```

The test cases used a Range(0, 4) object with parameters (-2, 2) and (2, 4).

Mutants:

9. Incremented (a++) double field lower → SURVIVED 
Test cases would not detect off by 1 errors since the bounds are 2 apart.
10. Decremented (a--) double local variable number 1 → SURVIVED
Test cases would not detect off by 1 errors since the bounds are 2 apart.

Coverage would be improved by adding test cases using lower +/- 1 and upper +/- 1.

# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

## Range

The initial tests from group 14 lab 3 had 66% mutation coverage. A lot of the surviving mutants were either related to multiplication/division or increment/decrement. The mult/div cases were due to the use of a range object with a bound of 0 for a lot of the test cases. The 0 would be multiplied by mutations, but the result would not change. The increment/decrement cases were due to the fact that most methods were not tested using boundary value analysis with above/below steps less than 1. When the mutations incremented by 1 or -1, the result would not change.

These two aspects were addressed to create new test cases. Non-zero range bounds, and boundary cases with steps of 1 or smaller were used.

## DataUtilities

The initial tests from group 14 lab 3 had 91% mutation coverage. With such a high initial coverage it was found that many of the remaining mutants were equivalent mutants. There were many cases of post fix incrementing/decrementing variables that were either returned before the change took effect or the value was in a loop and in the next iteration the value is reassigned overriding the change. The following is an example from the calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column, int[] validRows) function. 

```
 Original Code
 
 for (int v = 0; v < validRows.length; v++) {
            int row = validRows[v];
            if (row < rowCount) {
                Number n = data.getValue(row, column);
                if (n != null) {
                    total += n.doubleValue();
                }
            }
 
 Mutant Code 

 for (int v = 0; v < validRows.length; v++) {
            int row = validRows[v]++;
            if (row < rowCount) {
                Number n = data.getValue(row, column);
                if (n != null) {
                    total += n.doubleValue();
                }
            }
```
*Since it is post fix incrementing row is assigned to the value of validRows[v] before incrementing the value, conditions are checked and then the loop repeats. Every iteration row is reassigned making the post fix increment completely redundant. 

There were also many cases of less than being replace with not equal in for loops that increment a variable by one. In the lines of code this type of mutant was applied to the statements always had the same result as the loop would break as soon as the variable being compared was equal to other variable in the condition. The following is an example from the equal(double[][] a, double[][] b) function. 
 
```
 Original Code
 
 for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
 
 Mutant Code 

 for (int i = 0; i != a.length; i++) {
```

The majority of the mutants that survived were identified as equivalent mutants, making the task of increases the coverage difficult. Additional tests were added that successfully killed new mutants increasing the coverage to 92% but achieving the target of an additional 10% was impossible. Additional tests were designed by first evaluating the mutant and identifying if it was an equivalent mutant that would never change the outcome. Then the mutant was compared with one of the existing tests to understand why the mutant was not detected. From there a test could be designed to address the mutant and possibly others. To confirm the test was effective the test class was ran as a JUnit test and then a Pit Mutation Test provided the JUnit test was successful. 

### Additional test cases for equal(double[][] a, double[][] b): 

*Explanations have been writen for the target mutant but in most cases the test ended up covering additional mutants. 

Mutant: Substituted 0 with 1 for the starting value of a for loop causing the first element to be ignored. 
Test: A new test was made using 2D arrays with the same length that are identical other than their first element. This killed the muntant because these two arrays appeared identical to the altered code when the two were not actually equal. 

Mutant: Removed conditional - replaced equality check with false for a condition to check if the two arrays are equal in length. 
Test: A new test was made where a and b were the same except b had a extra element. After the length is checked the function elements are checked based on the length of a, so with the mutated code a and b appeared to be equal despite b having an additional element. 

Mutant: Equal to greater or equal for comparing the length of a and b. 
Test: A new test was made where a and b were the same array except a had an additional row. Because a was greater in length than b the condition would evaluate to true and true would return even though the arrays were not equal. 

Mutant: Incremented (++a) integer local variable number 2 which incremented the index that two arrays were compared at in a loop causing the first rows to be skipped. 
Test: A new test was made where a and b were identical except the values in their first rows were different causing the arrays to be evaluated as equal under the mutated code when they are not actually equal. 


# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy

Equivalent mutants will artificially reduce you mutation score accuracy, since test cases cannot kill them. To attain an accurate score, all equivalent classes must be detected and accounted for in the final score calculation.

Detecting equivalent mutants is time-consuming and labor-intensive, making it a desirable task to automate. However, since the purpose of mutants is to assess test quality, it's often challenging to determine if a surviving mutant indicates an equivalent mutation or insufficient test coverage. Tests alone cannot reliably identify equivalent mutants, making informed human effort neccassary. Numerous studies have explored automated equivalent mutant detection, proposing various techniques including compiler optimization, mathematical constraints, program slicing, and laser model checker [1]. Yet, there's no consensus on a universally effective solution, and prominent commercial products addressing this issue are scarce. Given the inherent complexity of this challenge and the limitations of traditional automation techniques, leveraging AI solutions could prove beneficial. Existing or near-future AI could be capable of understanding the SUT enough to detect equivalent mutants.

Manually detecting equivalent mutants requires an understanding of the code under test. To find equivalent mutants we examined each line with surviving mutants and decided how the mutants effected the code. If we found the result of the code did not change after the mutation, it was deemed equivalent. And example is provided here:

```
private static double shiftWithNoZeroCrossing(double value, double delta) {
    if (value > 0.0) {
        return Math.max(value + delta, 0.0);
    }
    else if (value < 0.0) {
        return Math.min(value + delta, 0.0);
    }
    else {
        // The line below is discussed
        return value + delta;
    }
}
```
The mutation testing tool replaced return value + delta with return delta. However, the preceding if statement branches guarantee value is equal to 0. Therefore 0 + delta is equivalent to delta. In this case, the equivalent mutant indicates superfluous code. The code base could be updated to remove value in that line

Example: 

```
public static boolean equal(double[][] a, double[][] b) {
        if (a == null) {
            return (b == null);
        }
        if (b == null) {
            return false;  // already know 'a' isn't null
        }
        if (a.length != b.length) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < a.length; i++) {
            if (!Arrays.equals(a[i], b[i])) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```
In many cases in the DataUtilities class the mutation testing tool replaced the less than operator in a for loop with a not equal to operator. This mutant is completely undetectable by testing as it results in the same behavior in every circumstance. In both the original code and the mutated code the loops will iterate until the incrementing variable is equal to the variable on the right side of the comparison. The only way this could become detectable would be if the source code was changed making it a great example of an equivalent mutant.  

# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites

It seems a large number of surviving mutants used increment or decrement methods (x++ or x--) to modify parameters. Strong boundary value analysis testing using increment values at the boundaries of 1 or less would be effective in killing these mutants.

# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing

Mutation testing is effective at evaluating the quality of test suites. Line/Method/Branch etc coverage metrics might show a high degree of code coverage, but they might not effectively test for bugs. Mutation testing will estimate the quality automatically. It provides another metric the programmer can use to evaluate their work.

However, mutation testing can be computationally expensive, depending on the code base size. It's effectiveness is also reduced by the generation of equivalent mutants. Sources say detecting and accounting for equivalent mutants can take a long. However, some articles suggest this can be mitigated if the programmer applies mutation testing as they develop the source code. That way they are familiar with the code and the analysis time is greatly reduced.

# Explain your SELENUIM test case design process

The website under test was explored to determine its functions. The main functions were identified as candidates for testing. Selenium IDE was then turned on and tests were recorded. At the end of each test, text on the final webpage was tested using Assert to ensure the test was successful.

The functions we chose to test were:
1. Login (both successful and unsuccessful) and Logout - 3 tests
2. Search
3. Browse items by room
6. Change language
7. Add to cart
8. Browse rental equipment

# Explain the use of assertions and checkpoints

Assertions, or checkpoints, are used to verify the website performed as intended. Assertions regarding various states of any html element can be used. The states include existence, visibility and content. For instance, the existence of the title of a unique page can be asserted to test if the page was navigated to successfully.

# how did you test each functionaity with different test data

Most functions we tested were rerun with alternative data. 
- For login, we used successful and unsuccessful login, and logout.
- For search, we searched for two different items and verified the search results
- For Browse we browsed using different room catagories and verified unique results
- Change language did changed to French and to English and verified the displayed language
- For cart tests, and item was added and an item was removed
- For browsing rental equipment, different equipment was selected and verified as unique

No defects were discovered.

# How the team work/effort was divided and managed

The tests were developed as a team. Advice on using Selenium was shared.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

The high initial mutation coverage of Data Utilites meant improvements by 10% were impossible.

The Home Depot site uses special security that alters the id field of page elements on each reload. Getting Selenium to correctly use the same element each time was tricky. We ended up using the xpath of the elements with random ids.
